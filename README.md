This project trys to predict individual stock movement in the near future.
stock techinal analysis indicators are used as independent variables. response variables are next day's movement, 1/0.
To select better feature set, it impletemented a feature selection algorithm - recursive feature eliminating. Theoretically, this algorithm takes all varibles in, evaluates varible combinations, then output the feature sets with highest/higher ranks. Due to computing power and time limitation, only a subset of feature columns were selected for this project.
